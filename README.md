# Rustychat

I made this for DandyHacks Spring `18, and made the repo public because one of the judges asked me too.
It's pretty nasty, but is fairly solid.

To run the server, type
`cargo run --bin server`.
This will start a server at 127.0.0.1:7667.

To run the client, type
`cargo run --bin client <ip>:7667`.

If you do not supply an address argument, it defaults to 127.0.0.1:7667.
